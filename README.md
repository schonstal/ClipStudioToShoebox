Clip Studio To Shoebox
======================

Clip Studio exports animations as Name00##.png but if multiple animations are on one sprite sheet Shoebox will shuffle them. This will rename them so the animations remain next to each other.

Usage
=====

```
cd /directory/with/images
/path/to/convert_frames.sh
```
